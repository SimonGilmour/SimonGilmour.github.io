            I have spent the last 2 years studying and cultivating my knowledge in the
            computer systems technology program at Sask Polytechnic. This amazing opportunity
            has taught me the skills and experience necessary to thrive in the workplace.<br><br>
            Over those years I have developed a strong foundation in every aspect of the IT field. Including database management,
            programming, project management, communication, and website development!

            <p class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">
                Back in high school I took a computer science class that taught the fundamentals of programming.
                Along the way I was tasked with making my very own game. Along every step of the way I've had
                a burning passion to create fun and interesting game mechanics which has led me to where I am now. Along the way I've learned
                crucial skills such as project management, documentation, and many other skills to ensure I can keep on creating!

                When I'm not glued to the computer screen writing up code, I spend some of my time drawing.
